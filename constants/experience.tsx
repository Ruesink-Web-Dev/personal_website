          My current role is as a senior software engineer at DataChat, a
          start-up that builds a no-code data science platform. I work as a full
          stack engineer, building out new features and maintaining existing
          ones. I also work closely with the product team and other internal
          stakeholders to design new features and present them to existing and
          potential customers. My development work spans the entire tech stack,
          from the database to the front-end, and I am always looking for ways
          to improve our codebase and development processes.

          As a Product Development Engineer at Calimetrix, a Madison-based
          start-up specializing in the sale of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
          test objects, my responsibilities encompassed both technical and
          business aspects. On the technical front, I designed and constructed
          innovative test objects, contributing directly to product development.
          On the business side, I actively participated in devising sales
          strategies to enhance business growth. Beyond my primary role, I took
          the initiative to create an efficient inventory management application
          and produced compelling marketing collateral. Furthermore, I played a
          crucial role in the development of an international compliance
          program.

          I commenced my professional journey in technical sales at Plastic
          Ingenuity (PI), a prominent custom thermoformer. Concurrently, I
          embarked on a self-guided learning path to acquire coding skills.
          Interestingly, my self-study pursuits converged with my role at PI
          when the company sought a business-savvy engineer to spearhead
          Salesforce development. Leveraging my background in sales, I took
          charge of designing a user-centric system that resonated with sales
          personnel and added tangible value to their processes. This experience
          marked my initial exposure to the realm of user-centered software
          design, which captivated me with its inherent appeal.

          I completed a Masters degree from UW - Madison (GPA: 3.85), with a
          focus in cardiovascular fluid dynamics. I published a first author
          paper, attended international conferences, and designed intricate
          experiments. Amidst these achievements, I discovered two aspects of
          research that truly captivated me. Firstly, I thoroughly enjoyed the
          process of data analysis, and secondly, I found fulfillment in
          interacting with diverse individuals during conferences,
          presentations, and collaborations. I began contemplating research from
          a business perspective, leading to the realization that my true
          aspiration lay in Industry.
