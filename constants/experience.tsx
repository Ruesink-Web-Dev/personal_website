          My most recent landmark is Calimetrix: a Madison-based start-up
          selling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test objects. With only 8
          team members, my title as operations engineer hardly describes the
          extent of my responsibilites. I developed an inventory management
          application, created marketing collateral, helped develop an
          international compliance program, and manufactured product.

          Out of grad school I started working in technical sales for Plastic
          Ingenuity (PI), a custom thermoformer. In parallel, I began teaching
          myself to code. Eventually, my self-study intersected with my work at
          PI, as they needed a business-savy engineer to take over Salesforce
          development (Me!). Managing high-value opportunities put me in the
          perfect position to design a system that salespeople understood and
          found valuable.

          I completed a Masters degree from UW - Madison (GPA: 3.85), also in
          mechanical engineering, with a focus in cardiovascular fluid dynamics.
          I published a first author paper, attended international conferences,
          and designed intricate experiments. But what I enjoyed most about
          research was (1), data analysis and (2) the interaction I had with
          people (conferences, presentations, collaborating, ect). I set out to
          do something where I could satisfy both of those interests.
